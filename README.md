# Basketball Sports AI

NCKU Miin Wu School of Computing Project
YOLOv8 on Basketball Sports, including player detection, pose estimation.


## Pose Estimation
By using pretrained model, we can get the pose estimation result as the video below.
![example](./src/pose_estimation_example.gif)

with argument config:
- conf: Confidence threshold for object detection
- show_labels: Show labels in object detection predictions
- show_conf: Show confidence scores in object detection predictions
- max_det: Maximum number of detections per image
- boxes: Show boxes in segmentation predictions

We can get the result as the video below.

## Player Action Detection
The data set is provided by National Cheng Kung University Womenâ€™s Basketball Team.
And we use Roboflow platform to label the data set.

The current classes are as follows:
- Shot

By using the online model from Roboflow, we can get the player action detection result as the video below.
